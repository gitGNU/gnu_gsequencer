You need a realtime kernel in conjunction with ags in order to do more computing expensive synthesis.

Please visit http://rt.wiki.kernel.org for more information.

Following site gives you advice in configuring ALSA

If you have pulseaudio running you might run `gsequencer` with pasuspender like:

$ pasuspender -- gsequencer
