    <title>BPM</title>
    <para>
      The beats per minute (BPM for short) indicates the velocity of a song being
      played. To adjust the BPM of the project in-/decrement the spinner labeled
      with bpm. To edit patterns or notes at a more granular rate select the wished
      tact within the appropriate engine or editor.
    </para>
    <para>
      To calculate timings you divide 1 minute with the entered BPM and divide it
      with basic. For example you have a BPM rate of 120 and a 4/4 tact you would
      calculate the timing as follow:
    </para>
    <equation>
      <mathphrase>t = 1 / 120 * (1 / 4)</mathphrase>
    </equation>
